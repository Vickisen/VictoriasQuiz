Hi Victoria

Wow! This was a beautiful and well flowing experience, both in terms of game play and code. Extremely well done.

11/10, Välgodkänt. The organisation, the use of functions, the cleanliness of the code - it shows a deep understanding of professional development.

I'm struggling to offer any advice at all, the only comment I have is about code style conventions and it's not a critisism. This is beyond excellent, and well beyond what is required for this class and waaaayy beyond what was required for assignment2.

I'm not sure what you have planned for assignment 3, but this project would be perfect as it is.

The coding convention for JS is that opening curly braces (måsvinggar) should be on the first line of a statement:

function() { ...

For if / else loops the else is on the same line as the if closing curly brace:

if (..) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
